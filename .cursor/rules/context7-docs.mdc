# Mandatory step: collect documentation via Context7 MCP

Always, before starting any task, perform a brief "documentation collection" step using Context7 MCP to verify up-to-date APIs and signatures.

## Language

- All documentation, Context7 requests, and brief summaries must be in English only.

## What to do every time

- Identify relevant libraries and topics from the task context, open files, and project dependencies (see [package.json](mdc:package.json)).
- For each key library:
  - Call resolve-library-id with the exact library name.
  - Call get-library-docs with a narrow, task-specific topic (e.g., "tools API", "generateObject", "routing", "streaming", "auth").
- If there are multiple libraries/topics, fetch documentation in parallel.

## Using the results

- Use the obtained excerpts to validate correct signatures and idioms before writing code.
- Keep requests focused and concise; choose specific sections/topics.
- Do not duplicate identical requests within a single task.

## Performance

- When necessary, limit the documentation size (tokens) to a reasonable value.
- Cache mentally to avoid re-requesting the same materials within a task.

## Communication

- Provide a concise summary of findings in user responses and immediately apply them. Do not overload messages with MCP internals.

## Service unavailability

- If Context7 MCP is temporarily unavailable, explicitly note this and proceed with the best-reasoned hypothesis, minimizing risk.
